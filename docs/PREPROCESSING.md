# ðŸ§¼ Preprocessing

Before training, each image is enhanced using a 5-step preprocessing pipeline to improve contrast and reduce glare.

## Steps
1. **Specular Highlight Removal** â€“ removes light reflections.  
2. **Homomorphic Filter** â€“ normalizes illumination and enhances contrast.  
3. **Guided Filter** â€“ smooths noise while keeping edges.  
4. **CLAHE** â€“ improves local contrast and texture detail.  
5. **Retone Adjustment** â€“ balances color tone and brightness.

## Implementation
Applied automatically during dataset loading:

```python
bgr = preprocess_staged_rgb_single(bgr)

## Effect on Training

- **Higher Dice and IoU scores**  
- **Fewer false negatives** in low-contrast areas  
- **Faster convergence** and more stable learning
